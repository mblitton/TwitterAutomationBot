-   Tweet video links from accounts in the "Embed" list (This will embed a video into a tweet instead of retweeting)

Prerequisites
-------------

-   Python 3.6 or later
-   A Twitter Developer account with API access
-   A Heroku account for hosting the bot

Dependencies
------------

-   tweepy
-   pytwitter
-   psycopg2

To install the required dependencies, run:

Copy code

`pip install tweepy pytwitter psycopg2`

Setup
-----

1.  Fork or clone this repository to your local machine.

2.  Create a new Heroku app and add the following environment variables in the app's settings:

-   `API_KEY`: Your Twitter API key
-   `API_KEY_SECRET`: Your Twitter API key secret
-   `ACCESS_TOKEN`: Your Twitter access token
-   `ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET`: Your Twitter access token secret
-   `DATABASE_URL`: The URL for your PostgreSQL database on Heroku (created when you add the Heroku Postgres add-on)
-   `CHECK_INTERVAL`: The time interval (in seconds) between checking the accounts on the lists

1.  Add the [Heroku Postgres add-on](https://elements.heroku.com/addons/heroku-postgresql) to your Heroku app.

2.  Deploy the script to your Heroku app by connecting your GitHub repository to Heroku.

3.  Start the bot by manually scaling the worker dyno, or by configuring the app to automatically start the worker dyno in the "Resources" tab.

Usage
-----

The bot will automatically perform the following actions:

-   Like recent tweets from accounts in a twitter list titled "Like"
-   Retweet recent tweets with media from accounts in a twitter list titled "RT"
-   Tweet video links from accounts in a twitter list titled "Embed"

The bot will perform these actions periodically, based on the `CHECK_INTERVAL` environment variable.

Monitoring
----------

You can monitor the bot's activity and logs in your Heroku dashboard. Navigate to the "Logs" tab in your app's dashboard to view the logs generated by the logger.error statements. This will help you identify any issues or errors that may occur during the execution of the script.
